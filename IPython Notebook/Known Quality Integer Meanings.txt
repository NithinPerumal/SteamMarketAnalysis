Pretty sure about these:
0 - Normal items* (ex: http://backpack.tf/stats/Normal/Grenade%20Launcher/Tradable/Craftable)
5 - Unusual items (ex: http://backpack.tf/vote/id/56c30c47dea9e9c92d12234f)
6 - Unique items (ex: http://backpack.tf/stats/Unique/Team%20Captain/Tradable/Craftable)

*Note: These are usually not supposed to be tradeable, and are the results of hacks/bugs, hence the high prices. See: (http://steamcommunity.com/app/440/discussions/0/530646080851358206/)
