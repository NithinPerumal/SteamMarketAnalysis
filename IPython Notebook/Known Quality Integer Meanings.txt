I figured out all of the values here through trial and error using backpack.tf as a reference to make sure my assignments were correct.
If you notice anything wrong, change it!

*These are usually not supposed to be tradeable, and are the results of hacks/bugs, hence the high prices. See: (http://steamcommunity.com/app/440/discussions/0/530646080851358206/)
We probably shouldn't use these in any calculations, as they will usually be outliers with artificially huge prices.

**These appear to be mostly useless items that "no longer exist" (meaning that if someone's game is opened with one of these items in their inventory, it will disappear/turn into a different item).
Similar to Normal items, we probably don't really care about these, just exclude them from anything we do. They'll probably usually be outliers anyway.

***These items are crafted from 200 of the same unique item, so the prices tend to just be inflated versions of the orignal, which is a bit boring.
For example, 200 Unique Pain Trains crafted together --> 1 Collector's Pain Train. See: (https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Collector%27s)
